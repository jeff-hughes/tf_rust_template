# Tensorflow Python-to-Rust Template

This is a simplistic template to play around with how to build a Tensorflow
model in Python, save it, then import it into Rust for use in a production
application. The idea is to use the mature machine learning ecosystem in
Python for training, and then leverage the speed of Rust when using the
model for inference.
